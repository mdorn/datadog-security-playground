# Developer Guide

This guide is for developers who want to run the Datadog Security Playground locally using Minikube.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

### Required Tools
- **Helm Charts**: [Installation Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- **Minikube**: [Installation Guide](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start)
- **Docker**: Only required if you plan to rebuild assets

## Minikube Setup

**Important:** Use [minikube version 1.36](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/tag/v1.36.0) or older. Newer versions come with a custom 6.6 kernel without BTF support, which is not compatible with datadog agent.

**Configure Kubernetes Version:**
```bash
# Set Kubernetes version to 1.33.1
minikube config set kubernetes-version v1.33.1
```

Using a VM-based Minikube driver is mandatory, as the Docker driver will not provide the Linux kernel needed by the Datadog Agent.

For details on which drivers are supported on Linux and macOS, please see the [Minikube drivers documentation](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/).

### Linux Setup

**Option 1 - KVM2 Driver (Recommended):**
```bash
minikube start --driver=kvm2
```

**Option 2 - QEMU Driver:**
```bash
minikube start --driver=qemu
```

### macOS Setup

**VirtualBox Driver (Recommended):**

First, install VirtualBox:
```bash
# Install VirtualBox via Homebrew
brew install --cask virtualbox
```

Then start Minikube:
```bash
minikube start --driver=virtualbox
```

## 🐳 Building and Loading Docker Image

Before deploying the Python application, you need to build the Docker image and load it into Minikube:

### Step 1: Build the Docker Image
```bash
# Build the Python application image
make build
```

### Step 2: Load Image into Minikube
```bash
# Load the image into Minikube's Docker daemon
make load
```

## 🔨 Building Binaries

**Note**: Pre-compiled binaries are included in the repository. You only need to rebuild them if you're modifying the source code.

### Build All Assets using Docker

```bash
# Build all simulation binaries
cd assets && make
```

See [assets/README.md](assets/README.md) for additonal information.
